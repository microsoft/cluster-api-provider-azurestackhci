                description: "FailureReason will be set in the event that there is
                  a terminal problem reconciling the Machine and will contain a succinct
                  value suitable for machine interpretation. \n This field should
                  not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are
                  expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages),
                  but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with
                  the Machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that
                  manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would
                  be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are
                  unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself
                  being critically misconfigured. \n Any transient errors that occur
                  during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to
                  the Machine object and/or logged in the controller's output."
